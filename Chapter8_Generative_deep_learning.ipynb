    "extends well into creative activities. When I first made the claim that in a not-so-distant\n",
    "future, most of the cultural content that we consume will be created with heavy help from\n",

    "algorithm turning an image into a psychedelic mess of dog eyes and pareidolic artifacts;\n",
    "in 2016 you used the Prisma application to turn your photos into paintings of various\n",

    "人工智能来模拟人类思维过程除了前面那些被动任务，比方说目标识别，或者很多响应式任务，比方说车辆驾驶之外，还能拓展创造性活动的领域。当作者首次断言在不久的将来，大多数我们消费的文化内容都会在AI的帮助下完成，遇到了很多的怀疑，这些怀疑甚至来自多年的参与机器学习的研究人员。那是在2014年，仅仅三年后，这些怀疑开始逐渐散去。在2015年夏天，谷歌推出了一个Deep Dream算法能够将图像转换成具有魔幻色彩的狗眼睛和古董的图像，吸引了很多人的注意；在2016年用户可以使用Prisma应用来将自己的照片转换成不同风格的画像；在2016年夏天，一部实验性的短电影叫Sunspring被摄制出来，其中的剧本使用了LSTM生成。很有可能最近你听到的一些音乐也是由神经网络申城的。\n",

    "> Granted, the artistic productions we have seen from AI so far are all fairly\n",
    "low-quality. AI is not anywhere close to rivaling human screenwriters, painters and\n",
    "composers. But replacing humans was always besides the point: artificial intelligence is\n",
    "not about replacing our own intelligence with something else, it is about bringing into our\n",
    "lives and work more intelligence, intelligence of a different kind. In many fields, but\n",
    "especially in creative ones, AI will be used by humans as a tool to augment their own\n",
    "capabilities: more augmented intelligence than artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "诚然我们目前看到的那些AI艺术创作的质量都还很低。AI距离与人类剧作家、画家和作曲家竞争还差距着十万八千里。但实际上AI的目标永远不是取代人类：人工智能不是为了将人类的只能取代变成另一种智能，而是为了为人类的生活和工作带来更多的智能，不同形式的只能。在许多领域中，特别是创造性领域中，AI将称为人类的工具并增强人类的能力：更像增强智能而不是人工智能。\n",
    "\n",
    "> A large part of artistic creation consists of simple pattern recognition and technical\n",
    "skill. And that is precisely the part of the process that many find less attractive, even\n",
    "skippable. That’s where AI comes in. Our perceptual modalities, our language, our\n",
    "artworks all have statistical structure. Learning this structure is precisely what deep\n",
    "learning algorithms excel at. Machine learning models can learn the statistical \"latent\n",
    "space\" of images or music or even stories, and they can then \"sample\" from this space,\n",
    "creating new artworks with similar characteristics as what the model has seen in its\n",
    "training data. Naturally, such sampling is hardly an act of artistic creation in itself. It is a\n",
    "mere mathematical operation: the algorithm has no grounding in human life, human\n",
    "emotions, our experience of the world; instead it learns from an \"experience\" that has\n",
    "little in common with ours. It is only our interpretation, as human spectators, that will\n",
    "give meaning to what the model generates. But in the hands of a skilled artist,\n",
    "algorithmic generation can be steered to become meaningful—and beautiful. Latent\n",
    "space sampling can become a brush that empowers the artist, augments our creative\n",
    "affordances, expands the space of what we can imagine. What’s more, it can make\n",
    "artistic creation more accessible by eliminating the need for technical skill and\n",
    "practice—setting up a new medium of pure expression, factoring art apart from craft.\n",
    "\n",
    "艺术创作中的一大部分都含有简单的模式识别和技术工作。这也是很多人认为不够有趣的地方，甚至可以跳过的部分。这些就是AI能够进入的部分。我们的感知模型，我们的语言，我们的艺术品都有着统计学结构。从这些结构中学习正是深度学习算法擅长之处。机器学习模型可以从图像、音乐或者甚至是故事中学习到统计学的潜在空间，然后就能在空间中取样，从而创作一件与模型训练数据具有相似特征的新艺术作品。很显然，这样的取样行为很难认为是一种艺术创作。它仅仅就是一个数学运算：使用的算法没有任何对人类生活、情感、世界观的认知，而是从“经验”中进行学习，并不具有我们的共情能力。它创造出来的作品只有通过人类观众的解读才能赋予意义。但是对于高超的艺术家来说，如果掌握了这种技巧，算法生成的作品可被引导到有意义和优美的方向。潜在空间取样可以成为艺术家的神奇画笔，增强我们的创造性灵感，扩展我们的想象空间。更加有用的是，它能通过消除对艺术家技巧和技艺训练的要求使得艺术创作变得更加容易，构建出一种全新的纯表达的媒介，将艺术领域和工艺领域分开。\n",
